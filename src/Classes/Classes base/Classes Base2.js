            Everything that has been constructed from houses and skyscrapers to bridges and superhighways start off
            as drawings. Those drawings are created using CAD (Computer Aided Drafting). This class will cover both
            engineering and architectural CAD techniques. Students will learn how to take a design sketch and turn
            it into a technical drawing that can be used to make a part that could be used to build an addition on a
            house. Sign up for this class if you are planning on a career in engineering, architecture, or design.
            Work on industry-related projects and create your own designs. Students have designed their own house
            plans and product revisions and worked with local companies on drawings that needed to be updated. This
            is a great class to get practical hands-on experience in the career fields of engineering, architecture,
            and design. Students also have the opportunity to earn college credits through Ivy Tech Community
            College.
